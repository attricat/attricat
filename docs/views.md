# View Configuration

Blueprint `views` define declarative layouts for catalog screens. The platform
renders known blocks and registered components; definitions never run arbitrary
frontend code. Views are optional, with schema-order fallbacks for blueprints
that do not define them.

## View Types

- `detail`: read-only entity preview.
- `edit`: create and edit form layout.
- `table`: scalar columns in the entity explorer.

`detail` and `edit` use recursive layout roots. `table` is a scalar field list
and does not support relationship columns yet.

```toml
[views.table]
type = "table"
fields = ["title", "price", "available"]
```

## Blocks

Container blocks are `stack`, `grid`, `section`, `tabs`, and `accordion`.
`stack`, `grid`, and `section` contain `children`; tabs and accordion sections
contain named `children` collections. Leaf blocks are `field`,
`relationship_list`, `heading`, `text`, and `divider`.

```toml
[views.detail]
type = "stack"

[[views.detail.children]]
type = "tabs"

[[views.detail.children.tabs]]
label = "Overview"

[[views.detail.children.tabs.children]]
type = "grid"

[[views.detail.children.tabs.children.children]]
type = "field"
field = "title"

[[views.detail.children.tabs.children.children]]
type = "field"
field = "price"
```

Every referenced field must be an effective attribute. `field` accepts scalar
attributes; `relationship_list` accepts relationships only.

## Entity Heading

The preview heading reuses a normal `stack` with the
`catalog.entity_heading` component override. Its first child is the scalar
field rendered as the page `h1`; subsequent children are subtitle or metadata
content.

```toml
[[views.detail.children]]
type = "stack"
component = { id = "catalog.entity_heading", version = 1 }

[[views.detail.children.children]]
type = "field"
field = "title"

[[views.detail.children.children]]
type = "text"
text = "Current catalog entry"
```

The entity ID is the fallback when the first field is unset or its renderer
fails. The heading block is removed from the normal detail body so it is not
rendered twice. This component is detail-only; its first child must be a scalar
field and later children may be text or scalar fields.

## Components

Data blocks select registered components with a versioned reference:

```toml
[[views.edit.children]]
type = "field"
field = "price"
component = { id = "catalog.field_edit", version = 1 }
```

The manifest and React implementations live under
`apps/catalog-web/src/features/views/components`. Component IDs use lowercase
dotted namespaces. The compiler validates component version, props, placement,
value type, and required `display` or `edit` capability. The frontend isolates
each field renderer with an error boundary.
