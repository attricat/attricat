# Configuration Reference

The API loads `.env` from the working directory at startup. `just setup` and
`just dev` create it from `.env.example` with persistent, worktree-specific
ports. Those port assignments are recorded in the ignored `.catalog-worktree`
file.

| Setting | Default | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Required | API and SQLx | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `BIND_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | API | Listener address. |
| `CATALOG_WORKSPACE_ID` | Bootstrap `default` workspace UUID | API | Workspace initialized with the configured owner during startup; it is not an HTTP tenancy selector. |
| `CATALOG_BOOTSTRAP_WORKSPACE_NAME` | `Default workspace` | API | Display name recorded while initializing the configured workspace. |
| `CATALOG_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL` | `owner@example.test` | API | Initial owner email. Startup trims and lowercases it before idempotently creating the bootstrap user, membership, and owner grant. Set a real deployment email; it is never an API input. |
| `CATALOG_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_ID` | Random UUID | API | Optional stable UUID for the bootstrap owner. |
| `CATALOG_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_PASSWORD` | Unset | API | Optional one-time local password for a newly bootstrapped owner. It is hashed before persistence and never updates an existing credential. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` | API | Adds `Secure` to browser session and CSRF cookies. Set `false` only for local HTTP development or test servers. |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | API | Structured tracing filter (for example, `api=debug`). |
| `PREVIEW_MAX_RELATIONSHIP_DEPTH` | `3` | API | Maximum recursive relationship preview depth. |
| `PREVIEW_MAX_RELATIONSHIP_ITEMS` | `10` | API | Maximum inline targets per relationship. |
| `ENTITY_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | `100` | API | Maximum page size for relationship browsing. |
| `DATA_HEALTH_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | API | Data-health response cache lifetime. |
| `CATALOG_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` | Vite | API target for the web app's `/api` development proxy. |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `catalog` | Docker Compose | Local PostgreSQL database name. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `postgres` | Docker Compose | Local PostgreSQL user. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Docker Compose | Local PostgreSQL password. |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `5432` | Docker Compose | Host port mapped to PostgreSQL. |
| `WEB_PORT` | `5173` | Vite | Listener port for the development web app. |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | API local development | Mailpit SMTP host. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `1025` | API local development | Mailpit SMTP port; `just setup` sets it to the worktree-specific port. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | `Catalog <no-reply@catalog.local>` | API local development | Sender address for lifecycle email. |
| `PASSWORD_RESET_URL` | Local web confirmation URL | API local development | Absolute web URL used in reset email; `just setup` uses the worktree's `WEB_PORT`. |
| `WORKSPACE_INVITATION_URL` | Local invitation URL | API local development | Absolute web URL used for delivered existing-user workspace invitations. |
| `WORKSPACE_ONBOARDING_URL` | Local onboarding URL | API local development | Absolute web URL used for delivered new-user onboarding links. |
| `MAILPIT_SMTP_PORT` | `1025` | Docker Compose | Worktree-specific host port mapped to Mailpit SMTP. |
| `MAILPIT_UI_PORT` | `8025` | Docker Compose | Worktree-specific host port for Mailpit's UI and REST API. |

Mailpit is a local-development and E2E adapter only; it is not production mail
configuration. Source `.catalog-worktree` after `just dev`, open
`http://127.0.0.1:$MAILPIT_UI_PORT` for manual inspection, and use its REST API
for E2E mailbox retrieval. Production mail delivery is deliberately deferred.

## Request authorization

All catalog API routes except `/health`, `POST /auth/discover`, and `POST /auth/login` require an
active browser session cookie. The API verifies its active membership and role
grant for each request; absent or invalid sessions are `401`, while a valid
identity without a matching grant is `403`. Unsafe requests must additionally
provide the `X-Catalog-Csrf` synchronizer token.

Browser sessions are scoped to the workspace resolved from the submitted login
identifier. Clients do not provide a workspace UUID or tenancy header.

`CATALOG_SERVER` overrides the CLI's API URL. The CLI otherwise targets
`http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
